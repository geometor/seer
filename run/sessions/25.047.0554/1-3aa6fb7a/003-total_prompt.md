Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule.

**Observations:**

*   **Input:** The input grid contains two distinct azure (color 8) objects. One is a 2x1 vertical shape in the second column, and the other is a 2x2 square shape in the fifth and sixth columns.
*   **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid *except* for the addition of a blue pixel (color 1) directly to the right of the top-most pixel of each azure object.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  If a cell is azure (color 8), check if it's the top-most cell of a contiguous azure object.
3.  If it is the top-most cell, change the cell immediately to its right in the output grid to blue (color 1). If the azure cell is on the right border so there are no cells to the right, make no change.
4. Copy every cell from input to the output

**Python Implementation:**

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
