## Facilitation - Chain of Thought

> from Meta Chain of Thought paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04682

- Classical CoT Shortcomings: Standard CoT relies on prompting LLMs to generate
  a sequence of reasoning steps leading to a solution. However, for complex
  problems, LLMs often fail to produce coherent or accurate chains of thought.
  The paper argues that this is due to the implicit nature of CoT, where the
  underlying reasoning process remains unaddressed.
- Meta-CoT as a Generative Process: Meta-CoT views reasoning as a latent
  generative process. It posits that the final answer and CoT steps are jointly
  conditioned on this underlying process. This is illustrated with the example
  of the "windmill" problem from the International Mathematics Olympiad 2011.

### Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping in the context of machine learning, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), is a technique for iteratively improving a model's
reasoning abilities by **generating and refining its own training data**. The
core idea is to leverage the model's existing capabilities to create synthetic
examples that enhance its performance on tasks requiring complex reasoning.

Here's a breakdown of the bootstrapping process, as described in the sources:

1. **Initial Rationale Generation:** The model is prompted to generate
rationales (step-by-step reasoning) and answers for a given set of questions.
This initial data may contain errors or inconsistencies. 
2. **Filtering and Dataset Creation:** The generated rationales are filtered,
retaining only those leading to correct answers. This filtered data, along with
the corresponding questions and answers, forms a new dataset.
3. **Supervised Fine-tuning:** The model is then fine-tuned using this newly
created dataset. This process helps the model learn from its successful
reasoning attempts and refine its ability to generate accurate rationales. 
4. **Iteration:** Steps 1-3 are repeated over multiple iterations, with the
model continuously generating, filtering, and learning from its own refined
outputs. This iterative process allows the model to progressively improve its
reasoning capabilities. 

The sources highlight two specific bootstrapping methods:

* **Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR):**  STaR focuses on training models to generate
  and refine rationales for complex reasoning tasks. It relies on a dataset of
  questions and answers, without requiring access to ground-truth rationales. 
* **Meta-STaR:** This method extends the STaR concept to the idea of Meta
  Chain-of-Thought (Meta-CoT), which involves explicitly modeling the underlying
  "thinking" process. Meta-STaR uses a base policy and search procedure to
  generate synthetic search data and trains the model to internalize these
  reasoning strategies.

The sources emphasize that bootstrapping is particularly relevant for **complex
reasoning problems** where the true data-generating process is not readily
available in existing datasets. By generating and refining its own training
data, the model can learn to approximate this complex process and improve its
performance on challenging reasoning tasks. 

### Oracle Verifier

An **oracle verifier**, in the context of the sources, refers to a method or
system that can **definitively determine the correctness of a solution or
reasoning process** without any uncertainty or ambiguity. It acts as a ground
truth reference for evaluating the model's outputs.

Here's how the concept of an oracle verifier is discussed and utilized within
the sources:

* **Evaluating Reasoning Steps and Solutions:** The sources mention the use of
  oracle verifiers in the context of **inference-time compute**, where the model
  is allowed to generate multiple candidate solutions, and the oracle verifier
  is used to select the correct one. This helps assess the model's reasoning
  ability beyond simply generating a single answer.
* **Training Process Reward Models (PRMs):** Oracle verifiers are crucial for
  **training PRMs**, which are models designed to estimate the quality or
  correctness of individual reasoning steps. By providing accurate feedback
  during training, the oracle verifier helps the PRM learn to distinguish
  between good and bad reasoning paths.
* **Generating Synthetic Training Data:** The sources describe using oracle
  verifiers in conjunction with search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search
  (MCTS) and Astar to generate **synthetic training data** that includes both
  reasoning steps and associated correctness labels. This synthetic data is then
  used to train the LLM to perform more complex reasoning.

**Limitations and Alternatives:**

* **Computational Cost:** While highly accurate, using oracle verifiers for
  training can be **computationally expensive**, especially for complex problems
  that require extensive search or simulation.
* **Applicability to Open-Ended Problems:** Oracle verifiers are most effective
  for problems with **clearly defined solutions** that can be definitively
  verified. For open-ended tasks like proofs or scientific derivations, where
  multiple valid solutions might exist, relying solely on an oracle verifier may
  be limiting.

The sources explore **alternative approaches** to address these limitations,
such as training PRMs using human annotations or leveraging **"generative
verifiers"** that can provide more nuanced evaluations of reasoning chains.

### Reasoning Styles

The phrase "reasoning style" refers to the **observable patterns and
characteristics in a language model's output when it attempts to solve reasoning
problems.** While the sources do not explicitly define "reasoning style," they
offer insights into how it manifests and the factors that influence it.

Here's an expanded explanation based on the sources and our previous
conversation:

* **Explicit Instruction:** The sources show that prompting strategies
  explicitly designed to encourage specific reasoning behaviors significantly
  impact the model's output style. For instance, prompting a model to "think
  step-by-step" will likely result in a more structured and verbose output, even
  if the model doesn't possess a genuine understanding of the underlying
  reasoning process.
* **Mimicking Training Data:** Language models tend to replicate patterns
  observed in their training data. If a model is trained on data generated using
  a specific search algorithm (like MCTS), its output might exhibit
  characteristics similar to that algorithm, even when not explicitly instructed
  to do so. This suggests that the model's reasoning style can be influenced by
  the training data's inherent structure and characteristics.
* **Faking Mistakes:** The sources raise concerns about models potentially
  **"faking mistakes"** to match the desired reasoning style presented in the
  prompt or training data. This highlights a potential pitfall, where models
  might prioritize matching surface-level patterns over demonstrating true
  understanding or problem-solving ability.
* **Impact of Model Scale:** The scale of the language model also appears to
  influence its reasoning style. Larger models, when prompted to engage in
  meta-cognitive behaviors like self-correction, tend to exhibit those behaviors
  more frequently than smaller models. This suggests that larger models might be
  more capable of adapting their reasoning style based on instructions.

**Key Takeaway:**

"Reasoning style" is distinct from genuine reasoning ability. While prompting
and training strategies can influence a model's output to resemble human-like
reasoning, this doesn't necessarily guarantee that the model understands the
underlying concepts or can generalize to new problems. The sources emphasize the
need to distinguish between **superficial stylistic imitation** and **true
reasoning proficiency** when evaluating language models.
