Okay, here's my attempt at describing the transformation:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Feature:** Locate all instances of the digit `8` in the input grid.

2.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   Check the immediate right neighboring cell and the immediate down neighboring cell, and replace the number by '1' if it is '0'.

In essence, the transformation identifies cells with color `8` and adds the concept of changing some numbers to '1'.
