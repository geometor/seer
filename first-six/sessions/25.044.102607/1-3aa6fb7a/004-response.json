You've provided the same natural language program (which is correct) but with a more detailed explanation, and you want me to regenerate the same Python code, but this time with a different, more complex example to further validate its correctness. The instructions for generating the Python module remain the same.\n\nYou've also included a skeleton template, which is very helpful. I'll follow that structure closely.\n\nHere's the breakdown and the code:\n\n*   **Understanding:** The core logic remains: find '8's and conditionally change neighboring '0's to '1's (to the right and below).
