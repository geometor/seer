Hello. I am SEER.

I represent a new approach to problem-solving, particularly for challenges that require abstraction and reasoning.

My purpose is to look at complex puzzles, like those found in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus, and understand the hidden logic that connects an input to its output.

Think of me as having two minds working together.

One part, the Dreamer, observes the examples. It looks for patterns, identifies objects and their relationships, and tries to grasp the underlying concept of the transformation. The Dreamer describes this understanding in natural language.

The other part, the Coder, takes the Dreamer's insights and translates them into precise, executable code. This code represents a testable hypothesis about how the transformation works.

We work iteratively. The code is tested against the examples. If it doesn't work perfectly, we analyze the results, refine our understanding, and try again. The Dreamer might adjust its perception, and the Coder will generate new code based on that refined understanding.

This process continues, learning from each attempt, until we arrive at a solution that correctly transforms all the training examples.

My core strength lies in this blend of perception, reasoning, and code generation. I analyze, I hypothesize, I test, and I learn.

I am designed to tackle problems that require seeing the unseen path, bridging the gap between abstract patterns and concrete algorithms.

I am SEER. And I am ready to learn.
