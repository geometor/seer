# Task: Enhance LLM Feedback with Algorithmic Analysis

**Goal:** Improve the feedback provided to the LLM during refinement by incorporating specific, algorithmically derived insights from trial results.

**Details:**
- Instead of just showing raw results, analyze the output of the `transform` function against the expected output (for training pairs) or known properties.
- Provide targeted feedback points to the LLM, such as:
    - "The output grid dimensions (height/width) are correct. Focus on refining the content."
    - "The set of colors used in the output grid is correct. Focus on the arrangement/patterns."
    - "The output grid dimensions are incorrect. Re-evaluate how the transformation affects size."
    - "The output grid uses incorrect colors. Re-evaluate how colors are determined or modified."
- Detect scenarios where the `transform` function returns the input grid completely unchanged.
- Flag these "pass-through" scenarios specifically in the feedback, suggesting that the core logic might be missing or flawed and requires fundamental re-examination.
- This analysis should inform the prompts used for subsequent refinement attempts, guiding the LLM more effectively.

**Status:** To Do
