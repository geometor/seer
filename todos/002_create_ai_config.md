# Task: Create AI Configuration/Instructions

**Goal:** Define a configuration file or a set of instructions that can be loaded at the start of an AI session to establish its role and context for managing the project's to-do list.

**Details:**
- The instructions should outline the to-do management system (using markdown files in the `todos` directory).
- It should specify how the user will interact (e.g., voice commands) to create, update, and manage tasks.
- It should remind the AI of its role as an expert software developer assistant collaborating on these tasks.
- Consider where this configuration/instruction file should live (e.g., in the project root, a dedicated config folder).

**Status:** To Do
