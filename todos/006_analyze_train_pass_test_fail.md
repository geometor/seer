# Task: Analyze Train-Pass / Test-Fail Scenarios

**Goal:** Develop methods to understand why a generated `transform` function succeeds on all training examples but fails on one or more test examples.

**Details:**
- When a trial passes training but fails testing, investigate the differences between the training inputs and the failing test input(s).
- **Proactively compare test inputs against all training inputs** to identify features, patterns, or conditions present in the test set but absent in the training set. This comparison could happen early in the workflow or as part of the failure analysis.
- Explore techniques to automatically identify these potential distinguishing features or conditions in the failing test input(s).
- Consider how this analysis could feedback into the prompting process (e.g., requesting clarification or refinement of the transformation logic based on the identified novel conditions or edge cases).
- Since test outputs are unknown, focus on analyzing the *input* grids and the *behavior* of the `transform` function (e.g., errors raised, unexpected output patterns) on the failing test cases compared to the successful training cases.

**Status:** To Do
