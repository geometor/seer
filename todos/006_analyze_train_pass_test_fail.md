# Task: Analyze Train-Pass / Test-Fail Scenarios

**Goal:** Develop methods to understand why a generated `transform` function succeeds on all training examples but fails on one or more test examples.

**Details:**
- When a trial passes training but fails testing, investigate the differences between the training inputs and the failing test input(s).
- Explore techniques to automatically identify potential distinguishing features or conditions in the failing test input(s) that might not be covered by the training set.
- Consider how this analysis could feedback into the prompting process (e.g., requesting clarification or refinement of the transformation logic based on the identified edge case).
- Since test outputs are unknown, focus on analyzing the *input* grids and the *behavior* of the `transform` function (e.g., errors raised, unexpected output patterns) on the failing test cases compared to the successful training cases.

**Status:** To Do
