# Task: Setup To-Do Management System

**Goal:** Establish a simple file-based system for managing project tasks using markdown files in a `todos` directory.

**Details:**
- Create a `todos` directory in the project root.
- Create individual markdown files for each task within the `todos` directory.
- Use voice interaction with the AI assistant to manage these tasks (create, discuss, update, mark complete).
- This task file itself is the first step in implementing the system.

**Status:** In Progress
