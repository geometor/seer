# Task: Implement Parallel Processing

**Goal:** Introduce parallel processing capabilities into the `Seer` workflow to improve performance and throughput.

**Details:**
- Investigate strategies for parallel execution, such as:
    - Running multiple independent tasks concurrently.
    - Parallelizing steps within a single task (e.g., generating code variations, running trials).
- Design the parallel processing mechanism to be configurable and potentially integrated with the swappable workflow engine (see Task 003).
- Implement controls to manage concurrency and respect external constraints, particularly LLM API rate limits (requests per minute, token limits).
- Refer to existing research notes and articles on parallel processing options explored for this project.

**Status:** To Do
