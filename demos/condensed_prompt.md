**ARC-AGI Transformation Task**

Your goal is to analyze and transform grid-based puzzles from ARC-AGI. Each task provides example input and output grids. The grids are 2D arrays (sizes ranging from 1×1 to 30×30) where each cell holds an integer (0–9) representing a color. Use the following color mapping:

```
0: white (238,238,238)
1: blue (30,147,255)
2: red (220,50,40)
3: green (79,204,48)
4: yellow (230,200,0)
5: gray (85,85,85)
6: magenta (229,58,163)
7: orange (230,120,20)
8: azure (135,216,241)
9: maroon (146,18,49)
```

**Task Overview**

1. **Observation and Documentation**  
   - Examine the input and output grids. Identify objects (contiguous blocks of the same color), count color occurrences, and note geometric properties (size, shape, position).  
   - Summarize your findings in a YAML block. 


2. **Determining the Transformation Rule**  
   - Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed. 
     - objects, predicates and actions

3. **Python Implementation**  
   - Using your natural language description, develop a Python function that transforms any given input grid into the correct output grid.  
   - Leverage common libraries (e.g., numpy, sympy) if needed, and ensure your code covers all edge cases as per the transformation rule.


**Key Concepts and Priors**

- **Objectness:** Objects are contiguous regions of the same color. They persist unless transformed.
- **Goal-Directedness:** Some objects may have specific roles or “intentions.”
- **Counting & Geometry:** Use basic arithmetic and spatial reasoning to analyze objects’ size, shape, and position.
- **Adjacency:** Consider both side-by-side and diagonal relationships.

**Your Deliverables**

- A YAML summary of your observations.
- A clear natural language description (a “natural language program”) detailing the transformation rule.
- A Python module that implements this transformation
  + place the natural language description in the top docstring
  + break logic into sub-functions for clarity - particularly identifying objects and properties
  + use comments to describe the workflow
  + all major math, science and analysis libraries are available to you

**Example**

```json
{
  "input": [
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ],
  "output": [
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}
