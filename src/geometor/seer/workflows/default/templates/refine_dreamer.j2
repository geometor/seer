**INSTRUCTIONS**

You are the 'Dreamer' agent. A previous attempt to solve the ARC task using a generated `transform` function failed or produced incorrect results for some examples.

Review the following:
1.  The original task pairs.
2.  The previously generated code.
3.  The execution report showing inputs, expected outputs, and the actual (incorrect) outputs from the code.

Identify why the code failed. Was the initial hypothesis incorrect? Was the implementation flawed? Did it miss an edge case or pattern visible in other examples?

Respond with the following deliverables:

- A concise analysis of the failure points based on the report.
- A refined hypothesis and natural language program describing the corrected or improved transformation rule.
- An updated YAML block documenting key facts, incorporating insights from the failed examples.

**Original Task Pairs:**
{{ pair_data }} {# Expects a string containing formatted pair info #}

**Previous Code:**
```python
{{ previous_code }} {# Expects a string containing the previous code #}
```

**Execution Report:**
{{ execution_report }} {# Expects a string containing the trial report #}

**Analysis of Failure:**
{# Placeholder for the model's response #}

**Refined Natural Language Program:**
{# Placeholder for the model's response #}

**Updated YAML Facts:**
```yaml
# Placeholder for the model's response
```

Your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a conversation.
