# GEOMETOR SEER

An AI-driven framework for solving abstract reasoning challenges by identifying patterns and generating algorithmic solutions. SEER uses a collaborative multi-agent system to transform problem descriptions into executable Python code.

## Components

### Core Engine (`seer`)

-   **Orchestrator**: Manages the problem-solving process using configurable workflows.
-   **AI Roles**:
    -   **Dreamer**: Analyzes puzzles, identifies patterns, and describes transformations in natural language.
    -   **Coder**: Translates the Dreamer's insights into executable Python code.
-   **Session Management**: Records all steps of the reasoning process, including prompts, responses, and generated code, into detailed session logs.

### Associated Repositories

-   **`seer_navigator`**: A Textual-based application for reviewing and analyzing the results from `seer_sessions`.
-   **`seer_sessions`**: Contains the detailed logs and outputs generated by the SEER agents during their problem-solving runs.

## Development Plan

See `ROADMAP.md`.
