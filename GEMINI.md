# GEOMETOR SEER

An AI-driven framework for solving abstract reasoning challenges.

## Overview

SEER uses a collaborative multi-agent system to transform problem descriptions into executable Python code. It is designed to tackle problems requiring abstract reasoning and pattern recognition, such as the ARC prize.

-   `workflows/`: Defines the sequence of operations for problem-solving.
-   `tasks/`: Contains the individual AI-driven tasks (e.g., Dreamer, Coder).
-   `prompts.py`: Manages the prompts used to interact with the AI models.
-   `session/`: Handles the management and recording of problem-solving sessions.
-   `gemini_client.py`: Client for interacting with the Gemini API.
