+we need to update our log methods in Session, they were cobbled together and have many errors. we also need to update Seer to call these functions from the right places.

+ok - let's start working on `_generate_content` - a few things to start with - first rename to `_generate` and update everywhere - next the call_count should be reset for each task

# 2025-02-10 11:40:03.854669
+let's rename call_count to prompt_count - and this applies to the total number of prompts called to solve the problem - this is also the index for the files - session files should all be in the task folder, remove the prompt and response folders

+/ask - `_generate` and log_response are doing a lot of the same things - perhaps a place to help reduce `_generate` is to move all the metrics processing to `log_response`

+when the grids are written in the example prompt - they are not in actual python
+
+and let's wrap the all the rows with he same indent after the first bracket

+ [0 8 0 0 0 0 0]
+ [0 8 8 0 0 0 0]

+i think the rich library has a special function for rendering markdown content for displaying - let's create display functions for both prompts and responses
